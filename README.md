   ```

2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://www.github.com/shincylabs/
   cd telemetry-server
   ```

## Available Scripts

The following scripts are available in the `scripts` directory:

- `./scripts/build.sh` - Builds the project in release mode
- `./scripts/test.sh` - Runs all tests
- `./scripts/lint.sh` - Runs clippy and rustfmt checks
- `./scripts/clean.sh` - Cleans build artifacts
- `./scripts/publish.sh` - Publishes the package to crates.io

## Development

1. Build the project:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/build.sh
